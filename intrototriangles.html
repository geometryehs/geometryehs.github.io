        <h3>Classifying Triangles</h3>
        <p>A triangle is a shape with three sides and three angles.
            We can classify a triangle by either its sides, its angles, or both. 
            Let's start by classifying a triangle by sides.
            <ul>
                <li>An Equilateral Triangle is a triangle with three congruent sides.</li>
                <li>An Isosceles Triangle is a triangle with two congruent sides.</li>
                <li>A Scalene Triangle is a triangle with no congruent sides.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Remember that congruent sides means that they are equal in length.
            To classify a triangle by its angles, we need to find the largest of its three angles first.
            <ul>
                <li>An Obtuse Triangle is a triangle whose largest angle is greater than 90 degrees.</li>
                <li>A Right Triangle is a triangle whose largest angle is exactly 90 degrees.</li>
                <li>An Acute Triangle is a triangle whose largest angle is less than 90 degrees.</li>
                <li>An Equiangular Triangle is a triangle that has three angles that have the same degree measurement.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Current Students</h3>
<p>On pages 358-360 in the textbook, I want you to work problems #2, 4, 7-14, 20, the odd problems from #21-43, 44, and 48.
These problems are due before the unit test.
