    <h3>Take the Diagnostic</h3>
    <p>The Arkansas State Test for Geometry is what is called an <strong>adaptive</strong> test. What this means is that when you answer a question,
    the next question that you get will be based on your answer. IXL is an adaptive software, meaning that your next question is based on your previous answer.
Each skill that is in the topics heading works like this. The dfference is that each skill is only focused on one particular ability. The ATLAS state test is focused on
everything that could possibly be learned in a Geometry class. What this means is that you may not have seen everything on the upcoming test, and that is okay.
What will matter is that you take as much time and put as much effort as you can on each test question so that the test will give you a correct score. These scores reflect
on our community and on our school, so even though you may not feel that it matters to you personally just know that it effects others in ways that you may not be fully aware of.

<h3>What Does My IXL Diagnostic Score Mean?</h3>
<p>
The number you receive at the end of the assessment represents the grade level you are on, based on your effort and skill. Here is a breakdown of each score:
<ul>
    <li>0-100: Kindergarten Level</li>
    <li>100-200: 1st Grade Level</li>
    <li>200-300: 2nd Grade Level</li>
    <li>300-400: 3rd Grade Level</li>
    <li>400-500: 4th Grade Level</li>
    <li>500-600: 5th Grade Level</li>
    <li>600-700: 6th Grade Level</li>
    <li>700-800: 7th Grade Level</li>
    <li>800-900: 8th Grade Level</li>
    <li>900-1000: 9th Grade Level</li>
    <li>1000-1100: 10th Grade Level</li>
    <li>1100-1200: 11th Grade Level</li>
    <li>1200-1300: 12th Grade Level</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>GRADED ASSIGNMENT:</u> The next two weeks will be spent in preparation for the ATLAS test. Over the next two days you are to take the IXL diagnostic assessment. You are to continue to answer questions to
    the best of your ability until you get a single number score. The IXL diagnostic assessment is adaptive, and similar to the ATLAS test in how it will work. Make sure that your assessment is in the Math Only setting. You can find it at the top right.</strong>
