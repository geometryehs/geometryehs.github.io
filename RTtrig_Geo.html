<h3>Introduction to Trig Ratios</h3>

<!=contains introduction information to trigonometry and an image of a labeled trig triangle.>

<p> We can define the sides of a right triangle by using one of the acute angles. 
	This angle is called a reference angle, and is often denoted by the Greek letter, theta (see image below for reference). 
	The side that forms the reference angle, along with the hypotenuse, is called the adjacent side. 
	The side that does not touch the reference angle, and is across from it is called the opposite side.</p>

<p>Trigonometric functions are functions that relate the angle measure of triangles to their sides. 
Each trig function is defined as the ratio of one side to another. 
The following list contains the main three trig functions or trig ratios:</p>

	<ul>
		<li> Sin(x) = opposite/hypotenuse </li>
		<li> Cos(x) = adjacent/hypotenuse </li>
		<li> Tan(x) = opposite/adjacent </li>
	
	</ul>

<h3>Solving for Sides</h3>

<p>
Trigonometry can be used to find the missing side in a triangle. 
All you need is a side that you have the measurement for, and an angle measure.
Then, simply work through the following three steps to set up a valid trig equation.</p>
	<ol>
		<li> Label the triangle's sides according to the angle you are using.</li>
		<li> Decide which trig function to use, based on which side you are looking for and which side you know. </li>
		<li> Write the equation, placing the angle inside the trig function, and the sides in the ratio.</li>
	</ol>
<p>
At this point you should have noticed that the variable is either in the numerator, or in the denominator.
That is, the top of the ratio or the bottom.
We will use the multiplicative property to solve the trigonometric equation for the variable. 
</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If the variable is on top, multiply both sides by the denominator in order to isolate the variable.</li>
		<li>If the variable is on the bottom, first multlilply both sides by the denominator. Then divide both sides by the trig function. This will isolate the variable.</li>
	</ol>
<p>Unless you want to use an outdated and horrendously long trig table,
then you can simply enter in your result into a scientific calculator in order to solve for the variable.
Make sure that your calculator has been set to degree mode before entering it in though, otherwise you may get a radian measure.
The radian measurement is not wrong, but the degree measurement will be more commonly used for right triangle trigonometry.</p>

<h3>Solving for Angles</h3>

<p></p>


<h3>Current Students</h3>
<p>On pages 358-360 in the textbook, I want you to work problems #2, 4, 7-14, 20, the odd problems from #21-43, 44, and 48.
These problems are due before the unit test.
